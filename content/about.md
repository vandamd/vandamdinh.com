Hey! I'm a 21 year old software engineer based in Bristol, UK. I'm currently studying Engineering Mathematics at Bristol University for my fourth year.

I was prev. working at Dyson, solving robotic-simulation-esque problems along with some MyDyson cloud stuff too.

# What I'm focusing on right now
1. Completing my degree
2. Achieving a one arm pull-up
3. 100wpm gallium v2 on voyager
