Hey! I'm a 21 year old software engineer based in Bristol, UK. I'm currently studying Engineering Mathematics at Bristol University for my fourth year.

I was prev. working at Dyson, solving robotic-simulation-esque problems along with some MyDyson cloud stuff too.

# What I'm focusing on right now
1. Building something for robots
2. Attending university
3. Attaining V6 on the moonboard
