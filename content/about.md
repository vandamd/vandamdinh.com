Hey! I'm a 21 year old software engineer based in Bristol, UK. I'm currently studying Engineering Mathematics at Bristol University for my fourth year.

I was prev. working at Dyson, solving robotic-simulation-esque problems along with some MyDyson cloud stuff too. 

# What I'm focusing on right now
1. Building something...
2. University
3. Attaining V5 on 2024 Moonboard
